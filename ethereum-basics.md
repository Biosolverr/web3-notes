# Ethereum basics (quick notes)

- EOA vs Contract accounts
- Gas = unit of computation, paid in ETH

- Events are for logs (useful for indexing & UI)

## Common terms
- RPC: node endpoint (Infura/Alchemy/self-hosted)
- ABI: interface for contract interaction
- Chain ID: network identifier (e.g., 1 mainnet, 11155111 sepolia)
